twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle, twinkle, little star
