well, i come from alabama
with my banjo on my knee
and i'm bound for louisiana
my own true love for to see
it did rain all night the day i left
the weather was bone dry
the sun was so hot i froze myself
susanne, don't you go on and cry
i said, oh, susannah
now, don't you cry for me
as i come from alabama
with this banjo on my knee
well, i had myself a dream the other night
when everything was still
i dreamed that i saw my girl susanne
she was coming around the hill
now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
a tear was in her eye
i said, that i come from dixie land
susanne, don't you break down and cry
i said, oh, susannah
now, don't you cry for me
'cause i come from alabama
with my banjo on my knee
